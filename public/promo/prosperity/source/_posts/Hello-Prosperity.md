title: Hello Prosperity
---

Prosperity is a strategic text-based resource-management city-builder incremental game. Whew what a mouthful! Let's break it down. You are the leader of a group of people seeking refuge from the conflicts between The Princess and The Warlord. Start from nothing, and build your way up. Along the way you will get help but also face obstacles.

Manage production lines, natural resources, relationship with other towns, and respond to events. Make choices that will shape the lives of your followers. Will you take them down a path of destruction, or will you lead them to prosperity?


## Mechanics

### Changing Seasons

As seasons change, the environment changes. Some jobs may only work when the season is appropriate. How do you plan for the changing of seasons?

### Deep, complex ecology

Some resources are renewable, some are not. Different buildings and jobs have different impacts on the environment. Can you find balance?

### Work, Learn, Expand

As workers are put to work, they produce goods and experience in their respective fields. The experience can be spent on unlocking new technologies to help you expand. Which sectors will you focus on?

### Everything is connected

Production lines feed the economy, but your workers may not be capable of producing all the different goods you'll need. Additionally, other towns may be more efficient at producing some goods. Will you reach out to trade with them?

### Always a new challenge

Prosperity sets itself apart by introducing new challenges in an organic way as mechanics naturally come into play. How will you manage your town?
